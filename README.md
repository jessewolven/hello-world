My first repository in GitHub


This is my first pull request on GitHub

Hello, this is my first repository in GitHub. I go to Michigan State University which typically uses GitLab. I feel like GitHub is just as relevant so I'm familiarizing myself with it.

This will eventually be my primary site for my repositories.
